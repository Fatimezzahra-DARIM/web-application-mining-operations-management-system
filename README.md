## Web application mining operations management system   
***********************************************************************************
A web-based mining operations management system can help to address several problems that are commonly faced in the mining industry, such as:

**Decision Making:**  
Without proper data analysis and visualization, it can be difficult for mine operators to make informed decisions about where to drill, how to extract minerals, and   how to optimize production. A web-based system can help to provide a comprehensive view of mining operations, including data analysis and visualization capabilities,   to support decision making.  

**Inefficiency:**  
Without proper management and tracking of mining operations, it can be difficult to identify areas for improvement and optimize production. A web-application system   can help mine operators to better understand and manage their operations, resulting in increased efficiency and productivity. 

**Long search time and downtime:**  
Mining equipment is expensive and downtime can be costly. A web application system with functionality to manage new studies and have a global view of the work of all   geologists can help reduce downtime and research.
